# Stripe-Checkout-Session-Button
This is a simple Stripe Checkout Session Button using HTML, Javascript and Flask(Python), part of a collection of all the different types of checkout that can be made with Stripe. Even being that simple, IÂ´ve enjoyed this project as is my first Full Stack project, allowing me to connect my Frontend and my Backend through the Stripe API.
